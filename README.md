# MIT-based Motor Designer Tool

A simple calculation tool for the calculation of parameters of low mass, high torque motor design based on required parameters.

The calculations are based on the theses:
* "*Design of a Low-Mass High-Torque Brushless Motor for Application in Quadruped Robotics*" by Niaja Nichole Farve
* "*Modeling, Design, and Optimization of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machines*" by Matthew G. Angle
